# AI Security Crew

A lightweight MCP server for security reviews built for vibe coding — injects security requirements prior to code generation, scans dependencies for CVEs, and verifies generated code, all without breaking your coding rhythm.

**Jump to installation:**
- [MCP Server](#quick-start) — full feature set with Jira, Confluence, CVE scanning (with reachability), and threat modeling
- [Claude Code Hook](#claude-code-hook) — automatic security review on every feature-building prompt, no manual commands needed
- [Claude Code Plugin](#claude-code-plugin) — install 3 security skills globally in Claude Code (no Jira/MCP needed)
- [Claude Code Skills only](#claude-code-skills) — manually add slash commands to a specific project

---

## Claude Code Hook

Automatically injects a security review into every feature-building prompt — no manual command needed. Once installed, the hook fires whenever Claude Code detects intent to build something (e.g. "implement", "add", "create"), checks whether the MCP server is available, and routes accordingly:

| State | Behaviour |
|-------|-----------|
| MCP server running | Instructs Claude to call `lightweight_security_review` before writing code |
| MCP not running | Runs `SecurityAssessment` standalone (150+ OWASP guidelines) |
| Neither available | Injects inline OWASP reminders and setup guidance |

**Install globally** (fires across all your projects — recommended):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Srajangpt1/ai_security_crew
cd ai_security_crew
bash scripts/setup_claude_hook.sh
```

**Install for this repo only:**

```bash
bash scripts/setup_claude_hook.sh --project
```

Then restart Claude Code. If you move the repo later, re-run the setup script to update the symlink.

## Claude Code Plugin

Install all three security skills directly into Claude Code — no MCP server, no Jira, no configuration required.

```
/plugin install Srajangpt1/ai_security_crew
```

This gives you three commands available in any project:

| Command | When to use |
|---------|-------------|
| `/sec-review` | Before coding — get risk level, OWASP guidelines, and a security prompt for AI code generation |
| `/verify-code` | After coding — review code for vulnerabilities with a checklist and prioritized fixes |
| `/threat-model` | For new features — identify threats with evidence links, mitigations, and optional `threat-model.md` |

---

## Claude Code Skills

If you prefer to add the skills to a specific project only (instead of globally), clone this repo and the slash commands in `.claude/commands/` are available automatically in Claude Code when working in the project directory.

## Tools

### Pre-coding
| Tool | When to Use |
|------|-------------|
| `lightweight_security_review` | Before any coding task — get security requirements and guidelines for your tech stack |
| `assess_ticket_security` | Before coding from a Jira ticket — pull security requirements directly from the ticket |
| `perform_threat_model` | For significant new features — generate a structured threat model (STRIDE, attack surfaces) |

### Dependency security
| Tool | When to Use |
|------|-------------|
| `verify_packages` | When adding packages — confirm they exist with valid versions (catches hallucinated package names) |
| `scan_dependencies` | When adding packages — scan for CVEs and check reachability in your code |

### Post-coding
| Tool | When to Use |
|------|-------------|
| `verify_code_security` | After generating code — AI-powered security review against OWASP guidelines |

### Threat model persistence
| Tool | When to Use |
|------|-------------|
| `search_previous_threat_models` | Before creating a new threat model — check if one already exists in Confluence |
| `update_threat_model_file` | After `perform_threat_model` — write the threat model to `threat-model.md` in the repo |

## Agent Workflow

The server automatically sends workflow instructions to any connecting agent (Claude, Cursor, etc.) via the MCP `initialize` handshake. Agents will follow this workflow without additional configuration:

1. **Before coding** — call `lightweight_security_review` (or `assess_ticket_security` for Jira tickets)
2. **When adding packages** — call `verify_packages`, then `scan_dependencies` with the code that uses them
3. **After generating code** — call `verify_code_security` and follow the `review_prompt` to report findings
4. **For significant features** — call `perform_threat_model` and persist with `update_threat_model_file`

## Dependency Scanning

`scan_dependencies` uses [OSV.dev](https://osv.dev) to find CVEs and performs reachability analysis to determine if vulnerable code paths are actually called:

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `reachable` | Vulnerable function is called in your code — action required |
| `not_reachable` | Vulnerable function is not called |
| `not_imported` | Package is not imported at all |
| `uncertain` | AI analyzed the code but could not determine reachability |
| `no_code_provided` | No code snippets were passed to the tool |

Reachability is determined by (in order): OSV function-level symbols → keyword matching against the vuln summary → AI analysis via `ctx.sample()`.

## Quick Start

### 1. Build the image

```bash
docker build -t mcp-security-review:latest .
```

### 2. Configure your IDE

Add to your MCP config (Claude Desktop, Cursor, etc.):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "sec-review": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run", "--rm", "-i",
        "-e", "JIRA_URL",
        "-e", "JIRA_USERNAME",
        "-e", "JIRA_API_TOKEN",
        "-e", "CONFLUENCE_URL",
        "-e", "CONFLUENCE_USERNAME",
        "-e", "CONFLUENCE_API_TOKEN",
        "mcp-security-review:latest"
      ],
      "env": {
        "PATH": "/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin",
        "JIRA_URL": "https://your-domain.atlassian.net",
        "JIRA_USERNAME": "your-email@example.com",
        "JIRA_API_TOKEN": "your-token"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Authentication

Supported methods:
- **API Token** (Jira/Confluence Cloud): `JIRA_API_TOKEN`, `CONFLUENCE_API_TOKEN`
- **Personal Access Token** (Server/Data Center): `JIRA_PERSONAL_TOKEN`, `CONFLUENCE_PERSONAL_TOKEN`
- **OAuth 2.0** (Cloud): run `docker run --rm -it mcp-security-review:latest --oauth-setup`

### HTTP Transport

Run as a persistent HTTP service instead of stdio:

```bash
# Streamable HTTP (recommended)
docker run --rm -p 8000:8000 mcp-security-review:latest --transport streamable-http

# SSE
docker run --rm -p 8000:8000 mcp-security-review:latest --transport sse
```

## Security Guidelines

Includes **101 OWASP Cheat Sheets** loaded automatically into security assessments. Add your own org-specific guidelines:

```bash
python3 scripts/add_custom_guideline.py
```

Or manually create markdown files in `src/mcp_security_review/security/guidelines/docs/`:

```markdown
category: your_category
priority: high
tags: tag1, tag2, tag3

# Your Guideline Title
...
```

See [docs/ADDING_CUSTOM_GUIDELINES.md](docs/ADDING_CUSTOM_GUIDELINES.md) for details.
